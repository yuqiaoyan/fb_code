80,I just wish to know how a test is going to differentiate between THC that has been in a persons system for a few hours and that which has been there for a week? If someone is a regular user of Marijuana then a test will come up positive even if they are completely sober (THC can be found in a persons bloodstream for up to 30 days after using marijuana). The test result would also be dependent upon the type and strength of the Marijuana said person uses and the concentration levels that can be withstood by their body. I believe there is NO definitive way to test THC Blood Content Levels accurately at the present time and therefore ALL marijuana legislation should wait until there is.,2012-05-02T00:39:58+0000,1
