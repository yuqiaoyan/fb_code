"Bob, your commentary on the principles of the Tea Party warrant a retort.  Rather than restate 'em, I'll just number 'em.

1.  No, we don't want them here.  Page 6, Article 6 of my passport states that I will follow and abide by the laws of any nation I visit.  I expect foreign nationals to do the same here.  It's very simple.  We have laws, they should be followed.  You may not like them, but they're not negotiable because they are inconvenient.

2. Slavery?  Really?  Do you want to compare the CEO's to the Pharoah's now?  Honest pay for honest work?  Yes.  I'll agree 100% there.  Still, corporations move overseas for a variety of reasons.  Save money, pay lower taxes, and in the process increase revenue for profits or investment.  It may not be fair, but it is called business, not charity, and it is a reality in a globalized economy.  Let's take it further.  These business moved overseas so they could compete.  They do so because American's don't want to spend $30 for a toaster, or $100 for a t-shirt.  That was Americans pushing for that end result, not the CEO's.  American's didn't support small business.  Period.  That's why Best Buy, Wal Mart, Safeway, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. all grew exponentially and put most of the small businessman out of business.  Americans wanted to save a buck, and the corporations were forced into situations where they had to cut costs to stay in business.  Heck, up in Loveland we've had 3 private coffee shops closed down by Starbucks.  Can you honestly tell me that the local small businesses were supported by the public?  It'd be nice, but it didn't happen.

3.  Military is a waste of spending?  I guess that's why no one has invaded American soil in 70 years?  I agree, we should keep it with a defensive focus, but the reality is that our interests are far and wide, and well beyond our borders.  That, and the fact that currently every time there's a brushfire in the world, the world frequently insists we get involved.  Not always, but far too often.

4.  As someone who has been on the other side of the aisle, I can say that lobbyists can be very helpful.  Yes, it can be taken too far, but their expertise and knowledge are in fact useful tools to quality legislation.  You may not like it, and yes, I agree some have abused it, but lobbyists have a wealth of knowledge and resources at their disposal that help legislators pass bills that do more good than harm.    

5.  This one, well, you're wrong.  The founding fathers did see it as important.  They knew that a well armed citizenry was the best and first line of defense against tyranny.  Granted, I don't think my neighbor should own a bazooka, but I've heard far too many stories out of Arizona, California, and Texas, where the bad guy had automatic weapons and innocent civilians were at their mercy.  911 is 2-10 minutes out, and a locked gun in the closet is 15 seconds away.  Yes, a couple of wack jobs took it too far, but proportionately, it's a non-issue.

6.  I didn't say gut it, but I am saying reduce it.   Imagine if just some of the trillions of dollars it spends each year were given back to the American people to invest, save, and pay their own debts down with.  It would make one helluva impact on the bottom lines of every family in this country.

7.  I won't defend Reagan on that point.  Yes, he did.  He took it from $1 to $3 trillion.  That still doesn't excuse Obama from taking it from $10 to $15 trillion.  Why is it so reprehensible to insist the government spend within its means?  I have to do it.  You have to do it.  Every citizen has to.  Why can't the government?

8.  Deficit spending has to come to an end.  It's econ 101 and I know you understand the causes of inflation, crashes, etc., so I won't go into that, but Greece, Spain, Germany, and every other country is dealing with the effects of not doing it.  We're next.

9.  Those bailouts kept Americans employed.  I don't like it, but they did.  You can't argue for keeping jobs here, and keeping people employed, and then argue for allowing them to evaporate.  Still, it was a short term bandage, and it's been ripped off again.

10.  I recommend a flat tax.  Cut the IRS budget for staff to review them significantly, everyone pays, end of story.  The tax code is a monster and so confusing that the average citizen has to hire accountants to do returns each year.  Cut spending, level the taxes, keep it simple stupid, everyone's happy...well, almost. 

11. Everyone's getting special treatment.  See above.

12.  Maybe.  But, that's crossing a line.

13.  I mean personal freedoms, economic freedoms, etc.   The role of government is not to tell me how I'll spend my money, what services I'll buy, or who I'm going to wake up next to.  It's role is also not to tell me what/where I can practice my religion, etc.  

14.  As a former English teacher, I know what you're referencing, and really don't feel the need for a debate on the merits and relevance of linguistic evolution.  Perhaps you'd like to include old English, or Afrikaans in that, but I don't think we need to.  I know lots of people here that are immigrants and don't speak a lick.  All have been quite successful.  Still, they do have people helping them so they can communicate.

15.  But, at what point do we say the ""free"" values of an individual trample the rights of another?  What if J Q Public wants to bang goats because his values support bestiality?  How about if Mary Jane the nudist wants to sip her Starbucks in the buff while walking to school?  Perhaps, Bob, of all the issues you and I are discussing, I grant this is the most controversial and divisive.  The Nazi's perverted values, and I don't support that type of distortion in any context, or from anyone on either side of the political aisle.  To me, traditional family values are respect, honesty, integrity, dedication, and knowledge.  Granted , everyone's are different, but those are mine.  Unfortunately, these traditional values have fallen far by the wayside in large swaths of our society, and I firmly believe they need to be nourished again.  We are seeing the lack of these basic tenets in our schools, in our neighborhoods, in our discussions, and in our elected officials.",2012-07-11T02:09:22+0000,6181619439_466875436657789,obama,"WATCH: Mitt Romney campaigned in Grand Junction today, calling President Obama the ""outsourcer-in-chief"" when it comes to jobs.

"Bob, your commentary on the principles of the Tea Party warrant a retort.  Rather than restate 'em, I'll just number 'em.

1.  No, we don't want them here.  Page 6, Article 6 of my passport states that I will follow and abide by the laws of any nation I visit.  I expect foreign nationals to do the same here.  It's very simple.  We have laws, they should be followed.  You may not like them, but they're not negotiable because they are inconvenient.

2. Slavery?  Really?  Do you want to compare the CEO's to the Pharoah's now?  Honest pay for honest work?  Yes.  I'll agree 100% there.  Still, corporations move overseas for a variety of reasons.  Save money, pay lower taxes, and in the process increase revenue for profits or investment.  It may not be fair, but it is called business, not charity, and it is a reality in a globalized economy.  Let's take it further.  These business moved overseas so they could compete.  They do so because American's don't want to spend $30 for a toaster, or $100 for a t-shirt.  That was Americans pushing for that end result, not the CEO's.  American's didn't support small business.  Period.  That's why Best Buy, Wal Mart, Safeway, Home Depot, Lowes, etc. all grew exponentially and put most of the small businessman out of business.  Americans wanted to save a buck, and the corporations were forced into situations where they had to cut costs to stay in business.  Heck, up in Loveland we've had 3 private coffee shops closed down by Starbucks.  Can you honestly tell me that the local small businesses were supported by the public?  It'd be nice, but it didn't happen.

3.  Military is a waste of spending?  I guess that's why no one has invaded American soil in 70 years?  I agree, we should keep it with a defensive focus, but the reality is that our interests are far and wide, and well beyond our borders.  That, and the fact that currently every time there's a brushfire in the world, the world frequently insists we get involved.  Not always, but far too often.

4.  As someone who has been on the other side of the aisle, I can say that lobbyists can be very helpful.  Yes, it can be taken too far, but their expertise and knowledge are in fact useful tools to quality legislation.  You may not like it, and yes, I agree some have abused it, but lobbyists have a wealth of knowledge and resources at their disposal that help legislators pass bills that do more good than harm.    

5.  This one, well, you're wrong.  The founding fathers did see it as important.  They knew that a well armed citizenry was the best and first line of defense against tyranny.  Granted, I don't think my neighbor should own a bazooka, but I've heard far too many stories out of Arizona, California, and Texas, where the bad guy had automatic weapons and innocent civilians were at their mercy.  911 is 2-10 minutes out, and a locked gun in the closet is 15 seconds away.  Yes, a couple of wack jobs took it too far, but proportionately, it's a non-issue.

6.  I didn't say gut it, but I am saying reduce it.   Imagine if just some of the trillions of dollars it spends each year were given back to the American people to invest, save, and pay their own debts down with.  It would make one helluva impact on the bottom lines of every family in this country.

7.  I won't defend Reagan on that point.  Yes, he did.  He took it from $1 to $3 trillion.  That still doesn't excuse Obama from taking it from $10 to $15 trillion.  Why is it so reprehensible to insist the government spend within its means?  I have to do it.  You have to do it.  Every citizen has to.  Why can't the government?

8.  Deficit spending has to come to an end.  It's econ 101 and I know you understand the causes of inflation, crashes, etc., so I won't go into that, but Greece, Spain, Germany, and every other country is dealing with the effects of not doing it.  We're next.

9.  Those bailouts kept Americans employed.  I don't like it, but they did.  You can't argue for keeping jobs here, and keeping people employed, and then argue for allowing them to evaporate.  Still, it was a short term bandage, and it's been ripped off again.

10.  I recommend a flat tax.  Cut the IRS budget for staff to review them significantly, everyone pays, end of story.  The tax code is a monster and so confusing that the average citizen has to hire accountants to do returns each year.  Cut spending, level the taxes, keep it simple stupid, everyone's happy...well, almost. 

11. Everyone's getting special treatment.  See above.

12.  Maybe.  But, that's crossing a line.

13.  I mean personal freedoms, economic freedoms, etc.   The role of government is not to tell me how I'll spend my money, what services I'll buy, or who I'm going to wake up next to.  It's role is also not to tell me what/where I can practice my religion, etc.  

14.  As a former English teacher, I know what you're referencing, and really don't feel the need for a debate on the merits and relevance of linguistic evolution.  Perhaps you'd like to include old English, or Afrikaans in that, but I don't think we need to.  I know lots of people here that are immigrants and don't speak a lick.  All have been quite successful.  Still, they do have people helping them so they can communicate.

15.  But, at what point do we say the ""free"" values of an individual trample the rights of another?  What if J Q Public wants to bang goats because his values support bestiality?  How about if Mary Jane the nudist wants to sip her Starbucks in the buff while walking to school?  Perhaps, Bob, of all the issues you and I are discussing, I grant this is the most controversial and divisive.  The Nazi's perverted values, and I don't support that type of distortion in any context, or from anyone on either side of the political aisle.  To me, traditional family values are respect, honesty, integrity, dedication, and knowledge.  Granted , everyone's are different, but those are mine.  Unfortunately, these traditional values have fallen far by the wayside in large swaths of our society, and I firmly believe they need to be nourished again.
